# Adaptive-Chaotic-Marine-Predators-Hill-Climbing-Algorithm-for-Large-scale-Design-Optimisations
Meta-heuristic algorithms have been effectively employed to tackle a wide range of optimisation issues, including structural engineering challenges. The optimisation of the shape and size of large-scale truss structures is difficult due to the nonlinear interplay between the cross-sectional and nodal coordinate pressures of structures. Recently, it was demonstrated that the newly proposed Marine Predator Algorithm (MPA) performs very well on mathematical challenges. The MPA is a meta-heuristic that simulates the essential hunting habits of natural marine predators. However, this algorithm has some disadvantages, such as becoming locked in locally optimal solutions and not exhibiting a high level of exploratory behaviour. This paper proposes two hybrid marine predator algorithms, Nonlinear Marine Predator (HNMPA) and Nonlinear-Chaotic Marine Predator Algorithm (HNCMPA), as improved variations of the marine predator algorithm paired with a hill-climbing (HC) technique for truss optimisation on form and size. The major advantage of these techniques are that they seek to overcome the MPAâ€™s disadvantages by using nonlinear values and prolonging the exploration phase with chaotic values; also, the HC algorithm has been used to avoid locally optimum solutions.
